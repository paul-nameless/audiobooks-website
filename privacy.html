<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Pavlo Klymenko built the Audiobooks - MP3 & M4B Player app ("the App"). The App provides audiobook playback, library management, and text-to-speech conversion features. Some features require in-app purchases.</p>
<p>This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information when you use our App.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Information Stored on Your Device</h2>
<p>The App stores the following data locally on your device:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Audiobook files (MP3, M4B, EPUB) that you add to the App</li>
    <li>Playback progress and bookmarks</li>
    <li>User preferences such as playback speed, sleep timer settings, and appearance options</li>
    <li>Library metadata including book titles, authors, and cover art</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this data remains on your device. The developer does not collect, transmit, or have access to this information.</p>

<hr>

<h2>On-Device Text-to-Speech</h2>
<p>The App offers on-device text-to-speech conversion using Apple's AVSpeechSynthesizer framework. When you use this feature:</p>
<ul>
    <li>All text processing and audio generation occurs entirely on your device</li>
    <li>No text or audio data is transmitted to any server</li>
    <li>No internet connection is required</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Cloud Text-to-Speech Service</h2>
<p>The App offers a cloud-based text-to-speech service as an in-app purchase. When you use this feature, the following data is sent to our server for processing:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The text content extracted from your EPUB file</li>
    <li>Book metadata (title, author)</li>
    <li>Selected language and voice preferences</li>
    <li>Apple In-App Purchase transaction token for purchase verification</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not store any user data on our servers. Text content is processed in memory solely for the purpose of generating audio and is discarded immediately after processing. Generated audio is returned to your device and is not retained on the server.</p>

<hr>

<h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
<p>In-app purchases are processed through Apple's App Store. We do not receive or store your payment information. We receive only the transaction token necessary to verify your purchase and authorize cloud processing.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>The App uses Apple App Store and StoreKit for in-app purchase processing and Apple's AVSpeechSynthesizer for on-device text-to-speech. The App does not integrate any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking SDKs.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>The App does not use cookies.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Data Sharing</h2>
<p>We do not sell, trade, or transfer your personal information to third parties. When you use the cloud text-to-speech service, your EPUB text content is sent to our server solely for the purpose of generating audio, is not shared with any other party, and is not stored on our servers.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Data Deletion</h2>
<p>Uninstalling the App removes all locally stored data including audiobook files, playback progress, preferences, and library metadata. Since we do not store user data on our servers, there is no server-side data to delete.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>The App does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>We take reasonable measures to protect information transmitted to our servers. All network communication uses HTTPS encryption, and API requests are authenticated. No method of electronic transmission is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date.</p>
