                  Pavlo Klymenko built the Dinero - Budget Tracker app as

                  Pavlo Klymenko and is intended for use as
                  is.
                </p> <p>
                  This page is used to inform visitors regarding my
                  policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal
                  Information if anyone decided to use my Service.
                </p> <p>
                  If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to
                  the collection and use of information in relation to this
                  policy. The Personal Information that I collect is
                  used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with
                  anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
                </p> <p>
                  The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings
                  as in our Terms and Conditions, which are accessible at
                  Dinero - Budget Tracker unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.
                </p> <p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p> <p>
                  For a better experience, while using our Service, I
                  may require you to provide us with certain personally
                  identifiable information, including financial data such as
                  budgets, expenses, income, and transactions. The information that
                  I request will be retained on your device and is not collected by me in any way.
                  If you choose to enable iCloud sync, your data will be stored in your personal
                  iCloud account, which is governed by Apple's privacy policy.
                </p> <!----> <p><strong>Log Data</strong></p> <p>
                  I want to inform you that whenever you
                  use my Service, in a case of an error in the app
                  I do not collect any data or information from your device.
                  All your financial data remains private and is never transmitted
                  to any external servers.
                </p> <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p> <p>
                  Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are
                  commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent
                  to your browser from the websites that you visit and are
                  stored on your device's internal memory.
                </p> <p>
                  This Service does not use these "cookies" explicitly. The app
                  does not use any third-party code or libraries that collect
                  information through cookies.
                </p> <p><strong>Service Providers</strong></p> <p>
                  This Service does not employ any third-party companies or
                  individuals to facilitate the Service, provide the Service on
                  our behalf, perform Service-related services, or assist in
                  analyzing how the Service is used. Your data remains entirely
                  on your device or in your personal iCloud account if you
                  choose to enable sync.
                </p> <p><strong>Security</strong></p> <p>
                  I value your trust in providing us your
                  Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially
                  acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method
                  of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic
                  storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot
                  guarantee its absolute security.
                </p> <p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></p> <p>
                  This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on
                  a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note
                  that these external sites are not operated by me.
                  Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the
                  Privacy Policy of these websites. I have
                  no control over and assume no responsibility for the content,
                  privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or
                  services.
                </p> <p><strong>Children's Privacy</strong></p> <!----> <div><p>
                    I do not knowingly collect personally
                    identifiable information from children. I
                    encourage all children to never submit any personally
                    identifiable information through
                    the Application and/or Services.
                    I encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor
                    their children's Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing
                    their children never to provide personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child
                    has provided personally identifiable information to us through the Application and/or Services,
                    please contact us. You must also be at least 16 years of age to consent to the processing
                    of your personally identifiable information in your country (in some countries we may allow your parent
                    or guardian to do so on your behalf).
                  </p></div> <p><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></p> <p>
