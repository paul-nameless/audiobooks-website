    <li>Cloud processing tokens issued upon purchase expire after 30 days.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>User Content</h2>

    <li>The App does not provide, host, or distribute book content.</li>
    <li>You are solely responsible for ensuring you have the necessary rights to any content you add to the App.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cloud Processing Terms</h2>
<p>When you use the cloud text-to-speech service:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Text content from your EPUB files is transmitted to our server for processing.</li>
